# LSP Example

Heavily documented sample code for https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-language-server.

## Functionality

This Language Server works for plain text file. It has the following language features:
- Completions
- Diagnostics regenerated on each file change or configuration change

It also includes an End-to-End test.

## Structure

```
.
├── client // Language Client
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── test // End to End tests for Language Client / Server
│   │   └── extension.ts // Language Client entry point
├── package.json // The extension manifest.
└── server // Language Server
    └── src
        └── server.ts // Language Server entry point
```

## Compile and Run

- Run `npm install` in this folder. This installs all necessary npm modules in both the client and server folder
- Open VS Code on this folder.
- Press Ctrl+Shift+B to compile the client and server.
- Switch to the Debug viewlet.
- Select `Launch Client` from the drop down.
- Run the lauch config.
- If you want to debug the server as well use the launch configuration `Attach to Server`
- In the [Extension Development Host] instance of VSCode, open a document in 'plain text' language mode.
  - Type `j` or `t` to see `Javascript` and `TypeScript` completion.
  - Enter text content such as `AAA aaa BBB`. The extension will emit diagnostics for all words in all-uppercase.
