# Crane - PHP code-completion for VS Code

Crane is a productivity enhancement extension for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) that provides code-completion for PHP. It has zero dependencies and largely works with projects of any size. It is still in development, and as such there may be bugs and/or missing features.

Please report any bugs that you find in our [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/HvyIndustries/crane/issues).

Follow [@HvyIndustries](https://twitter.com/HvyIndustries) on Twitter for updates!

## How To Get Started

1. Install Crane by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> in VS Code, then typing `ext install crane`
2. Open a PHP project
3. Check the status bar at the bottom and watch Crane parse all the PHP files it finds

- Optionally, install the PHP Stubs to get code-completion for the built in PHP classes by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> in VS Code, then typing `crane php stubs` and selecting the appropriate option from the list.

For the best development experience, make sure you have the PHP linter enabled in your user settings, and set it to run `onType` instead of `onSave`!

You can also set `php.suggest.basic` to `false` to disable VS Code's built-in php code completion and avoid duplicate suggestions.

* There can be strange behaviour when working with PHP and HTML in the same file.
* If you have a syntax error in a file, you may not get a full list of suggestions for that file.
